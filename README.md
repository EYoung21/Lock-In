#Lock In
A productivity app.




<<<<<<< HEAD
This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

# Lock In

Lock In is a productivity app designed to help you stay focused and motivated while working on your tasks. The app provides features such as a secure safe, a stopwatch, and a currency system to gamify your productivity.

## Features

### Safe
- The app includes a safe feature that allows you to lock in your tasks. 
- When you lock in, the safe displays different images based on your progress, motivating you to complete your tasks.

### Stopwatch
- Lock In includes a stopwatch feature that tracks the time you spend on your tasks.
- The stopwatch starts automatically when you lock in and resets when you lock out.

### Currency System
- Lock In features a currency system where you earn virtual currency based on the time spent on tasks.
- The currency earned can be used to unlock rewards or incentives within the app (coming soon).

## Getting Started

To get started with Lock In (will come to app stores normally soon), follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
4. Start the Metro server using `npm start` or `yarn start`.
5. Run the app on your preferred platform using `npm run android` or `npm run ios` for Android and iOS respectively.
